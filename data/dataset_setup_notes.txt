====================
ðŸ“š Dataset Setup
====================

We are using the **Cityscapes** and **Foggy Cityscapes** datasets.

Directory Structure:
--------------------
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ cityscapes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ leftImg8bit (clear images)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gtFine (annotations)
â””â”€â”€ foggy_cityscapes/
    â””â”€â”€ leftImg8bit_foggy (foggy images, symbolic link)

ðŸ”— Symbolic Link (Foggy Dataset)
--------------------------------
The `leftImg8bit_foggy` dataset is stored on Google Drive due to its large size. 
To integrate this into your local project without copying large datasets:

Run the following command **once**, from the root of the project directory:

    ln -s "/Users/eliasmapendo/Google Drive/My Drive/leftImg8bit_foggy" data/foggy_cityscapes/leftImg8bit_foggy

Important:
- Ensure Google Drive is set to "**Available offline**" for the folder to avoid file-access issues.
- Double-check the symbolic link by running:

      ls data/foggy_cityscapes/leftImg8bit_foggy

  You should see:

      train  val  test

Additional Information:
-----------------------

- To use the symbolic link method effectively, first ensure you have **Google Drive Desktop** installed on your local machine:
  - Download it from: https://www.google.com/drive/download/

Reason for Using Symbolic Links:
--------------------------------
- The `leftImg8bit_foggy` dataset is too large to conveniently move or copy directly onto the local computer.
- Attempts to move or copy the folder from Google Drive directly may fail due to file size limitations, synchronization issues, or permissions.

By using a symbolic link, we avoid these issues and still allow seamless integration and usage of the dataset as if it were local.
