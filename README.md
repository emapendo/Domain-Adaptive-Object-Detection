# Domain Adaptive Object Detection for Autonomous Driving Under Foggy Weather
This repository contains the implementation of a domain-adaptive object detection framework based on Faster R-CNN for improving object detection performance in foggy weather conditions.

---

## ðŸš˜ Project Overview
Autonomous vehicles face significant challenges when navigating through adverse weather conditions such as fog, which can obscure objects and reduce the reliability of object detection systems. Most detectors are trained under clear weather, causing performance degradation in unseen domains (e.g., fog).

This project implements a domain adaptation approach using Faster R-CNN to bridge the performance gap between clear and foggy weather conditions without requiring additional labeled data in the foggy domain.

We train the model on Cityscapes (clear) images and adapt to Foggy Cityscapes using adversarial learning and domain classifiers.
